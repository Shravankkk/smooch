            <div class="timeline-content">It all started with that one magical picture from Manali. Aishu's first messageâ€”a long, thoughtful introductionâ€”made me feel like the luckiest guy. I thought, "Wow, she's different!" Usually, girls donâ€™t send such long texts, but maybe she liked me a little more than usual! ðŸ˜‰</div>

            <div class="timeline-content">We moved to Instagram, and suddenly, nights got shorter because time seemed to disappear while talking. Sharing posts, laughing over memes, sending emojis (except for that thumbs-upâ€”I never liked that one ðŸ˜‚)â€”it felt like we couldnâ€™t stop.</div>

            <div class="timeline-content">The day arrived. My heart was racing, and I was excited to finally see her. I left on time (of course!), but Aishuâ€¦ well, timing wasnâ€™t exactly her thing that day. She didnâ€™t even know which mall to go to, and she was saying she had taken an auto! ðŸ˜† She arrived at the mall but wasnâ€™t sure which floor to go to, and I waited downstairs while she looked around. When we finally spotted each other, we exchanged that first look, confirmed it was us, shared a little hug, and went in for the movie.<br><br>She watched the movie, and Iâ€”well, I watched her and the movie. ðŸ˜Š Afterward, we headed to a cafÃ©. I was a little shy at first, but she made it easy. It was one of those days you wish could last longer. And as we booked a cab to head back, I rested my hand on her shoulder, and we talked some more. Time flew by so quickly, and I wondered if she enjoyed it as much as I did... and whether weâ€™d meet again soon. ðŸ’–</div>
