            <p>My Sweet Aishu,</p>
            <p>I donâ€™t know exactly how to start this, but Iâ€™ll begin with what I love about you. You are so sweet and you understand me so well. There are times when I get upset and lose my coolâ€”<i>mein tumpe chilla deta hoon</i>â€”and I know I shouldnâ€™t, but somehow, you always manage to handle it so calmly. Youâ€™re so caring, and I like you sooo much! ðŸ’–</p>
            <p>You are my little kucchii pucchiiiâ€”my cute little panda. Spending time with you is always the highlight of my day, whether weâ€™re going out together, clicking cute photos, cooking meals, or just watching a movie. Even when weâ€™re studying together, I love every moment I spend with you.</p>
            <p>I want you by my side in everything we aspire to do together, and I canâ€™t wait for all the adventures ahead of us. Iâ€™ll always tease you (because you know I canâ€™t resist ðŸ˜‰), but Iâ€™ll also always try my best to make you happy and never let you feel sad. I love your adorable hand gestures, and your smileâ€”itâ€™s my favorite thing in the world. ðŸ˜Š And your little hands, they are the cutest, and I love holding them.</p>
            <p>I really admire how dedicated you are to improving yourselfâ€”whether itâ€™s going to the gym or becoming better at work. I know your job is challenging, especially with the added responsibilities onsite, but you still manage to juggle everything and find time for us. You travel all the way to see me, and that means so much to me. You always make the effort, and I appreciate it more than I can say.</p>
            <p>I canâ€™t wait to create more memories with youâ€”whether itâ€™s traveling the world, having lazy Sunday mornings together, or just sitting side by side, growing old with you. With you, my future feels brighter than ever.</p>
            <p>I loooovvve you, my cutie pie, apple pie, honeybunnn, pumpkin, smoochieee, Aishuuu, pookieee... my everything. ðŸ’–</p>
            <p>With all my love,</p>
